    The data monetization strategy framework consists of seven major components:
    1)	Business Goals: Define clear business objectives to align data monetization initiatives with organizational strategy. Establish a compelling value proposition to deliver measurable outcomes and drive growth.
    2)	Human Resources: Evaluate workforce capabilities, identifying skill gaps and focusing on upskilling or reskilling employees to enable seamless adoption of data-driven strategies.
    3)	Data Technology: Assess the organizationâ€™s infrastructure, including data architecture, platforms, and cloud solutions, ensuring flexibility, scalability and readiness to support advanced data monetization initiatives.
    4)	AI-Driven Analytics: Prepare the organization to harness AI and Generative AI for key operations such as acquisition campaigns, underwriting, and personalized services. Evaluate readiness to implement tailored marketing strategies and 24/7 customer support solutions like chatbots and voice bots.
    5)	Data Management: Review governance practices to ensure robust frameworks for data quality, security, compliance, accessibility, integration, and lifecycle management.
    6)	Metrics: Assess key performance indicators such as data availability and quality (e.g., accuracy), revenue growth (% uplift), customer satisfaction (CSAT), operational performance (e.g., adherence to SLAs), and cost efficiency (e.g., RODI) to evaluate success and pinpoint areas for improvement.
    7)	Monitoring: Establish systems to continuously monitor alignment with business goals e.g. dashboard, ensuring ongoing improvement and accountability in data monetization efforts.

    Data Architecture Framework for Virtual Banks in Thailand

    - The data architecture framework serves as a critical follow-up to the data monetization strategy framework, providing the necessary technical and operational foundation to implement monetization strategies effectively. After assessing an organizationâ€™s readiness using the data monetization strategy framework, this framework ensures that the technical infrastructure, data processes, and analytical capabilities are aligned with business goals for value creation.
    The data architecture requirements for New-to-Bank (NTB) and Existing-to-Bank (ETB) founders differ significantly, reflecting their unique challenges and advantages. NTB founders, often originating from industries outside traditional banking, must prioritize the development of scalable and flexible systems that foster innovation and adaptability to meet market demands. In contrast, ETB founders, with extensive banking expertise and access to legacy data, face the challenge of modernizing existing systems while ensuring seamless integration into virtual banking platforms. A thoughtfully designed data architecture framework is essential to addressing these distinct needs, enabling both NTB and ETB founders to establish competitive and successful virtual banks.
